Explanation of the Structure
includes/

Contains all PHP code organized into traits, abstract classes, and concrete classes.
traits/

Place reusable traits here, such as Singleton.php for implementing the Singleton pattern, which ensures classes like Main or TimeTracker are instantiated only once.
abstract/

Include abstract classes that define the base functionality for plugin components.
Example: BasePlugin.php, which might define common properties or methods like plugin activation hooks.
classes/

Organized by functionality:
Admin: Classes related to admin features (e.g., Metabox.php for the time tracker metabox and DashboardWidget.php for the dashboard widget).
Frontend: Classes for frontend features (e.g., Shortcodes.php for the graph shortcodes and Scripts.php for enqueuing assets).
Core: Core logic like time tracking (TimeTracker.php) or utilities.
assets/

Contains CSS and JavaScript files for styling or interactivity.
languages/

Holds translation files for internationalization (optional, but recommended).
content-creation-tracker.php

The main plugin file where the plugin is initialized. It loads the Main class and manages activation and deactivation hooks.
uninstall.php

Handles cleanup during plugin uninstallation (e.g., removing custom metadata).
